# sitsi -- the SOFT Inversion Toolkit for Synchrotron Images
This is the repository for ``sitsi``, a small Python toolkit for calculating
runaway electron distribution functions from synchrotron radiation measurements.
The toolkit is designed to be used together with
[SOFT2](https://github.com/hoppe93/SOFT2).
